## Technology Selection

![technology](doc/img/technology.png)

### User Layer

When building the front-end page of the system management background, we will use technologies such as H5, Vue.js, and ElementUI. When building mobile applications, we will use WeChat applets.

### Gateway layer

Nginx is a server that is mainly used as an Http server to deploy static resources with high access performance. There are two more important functions in Nginx: reverse proxy and load balancing. During project deployment, to achieve Tomcat load balancing, it can be achieved through Nginx.

### Application layer

- SpringBoot: Quickly build Spring projects, adopting the idea of "convention is better than configuration" to simplify the configuration and development of Spring projects.
- Spring: Unified management of various resources (beans) in the project will be used in all layers of Web development.
- SpringMVC: SpringMVC is a module of the Spring framework. SpringMVC and Spring do not need to be integrated through an intermediate integration layer, and can be seamlessly integrated.
- SpringSession: mainly solves the problem of Session sharing in a cluster environment.
- Lombok: It can simplify Java code in the form of simple annotations and improve the development efficiency of developers. For example, JavaBean that often needs to be written in development requires time to add corresponding getters/setters, and perhaps write methods such as constructors and equals.
- Swagger: It can automatically help developers generate interface documents and test the interfaces.

### Data layer

- MySQL: relational database, the core business data of this project will be stored in MySQL.
- MybatisPlus: The persistence layer of this project will use MybatisPlus to simplify development, and the basic single table addition, deletion, modification and query can directly call the methods provided by the framework.
- Redis: An in-memory database based on key-value format storage, with fast access speed, it is often used as a cache (reduces database access pressure and improves access efficiency), and will be used in later performance optimization.

### tool

- Git: version control tool, in team collaboration, use this tool to manage the code in the project.
- Maven: Project build tool.
- JUnit: A unit testing tool. After the developer's functions are implemented, they need to unit test the functions through JUnit.
